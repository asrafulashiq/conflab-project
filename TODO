Data Cleaning:
  ☐ how to handle missing values?
    ☐ remove the person with missing value
    ☐ only remove particular keypoint (preferable)
    ☐ only images that have many missing values

Train:
  ☐ perform hyper-parameter tuning

Todo:
  ☐ There will be two investigative experiments (ablations) characterizing the following: 
    + performance affected by increasingly more annotated data, 
    + performance affected by adding more keypoints to the task. This could be 3/4 splits: head+shoulders, head+shoulders+arms, head+shoulder+arms+pelvis&hips, full body. 

  ☐ For ablation on keypoints vs performance, the following grouping will be okay:
    Centre of head, nose, right shoulder, left shoulder, neck 
    + right and left elbow, right and left wrist 
    + right and left hip  
    + left and right knee +  left and right ankles, left and right toes
